## Summary
We created an app that allows users to easily upload images of stray dogs/cats in need of help. These images
are verified and sent to the nearest NGO's along with their exact location. The NGO can register at our site for free
and use our personalized dashboard. Latest images of stray animals involved in accidents is directly sent to the NGO without
any delay. The entire system is centralized and uses Django and Tailwind.
